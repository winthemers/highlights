WindowsNowPlaying for Rainmeter (by Bigparty):

NowPlaying already exist and allows to control several media players and WebNowPlaying already exist and allows to control Web players.

This one tries to control WindowsNowPlaying that can interact with WebPlayers and Media Players that are supported or not by the NowPlaying plugin. I will try to see if it works with PotPlayer in the near future.

Warning: It isn't made or supported by the rainmeter team. It is user made and uses an .exe file which you should use at your own risk.
